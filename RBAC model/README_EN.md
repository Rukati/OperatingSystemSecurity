# Implementation of a discretionary role model (RBAC) emulator.

Discretionary role model (Role-Based Access Control, RBAC) is an access control model in which access to system resources is determined based on user roles. Instead of assigning access rights directly to each user, users are grouped into roles, and each role is assigned specific access rights to resources. Users are given access rights based on their role, which makes rights management more convenient and efficient.
