# Generator of pseudo-random bit sequences.

A pseudo-random bit sequence generator (PRB) is an algorithm that generates a sequence of bits that appears to be random but is actually calculated using a deterministic process. Thus, pseudo-random number generators do not produce truly random sequences, but provide sequences that are statistically similar to random.
