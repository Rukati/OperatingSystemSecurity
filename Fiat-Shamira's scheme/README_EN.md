# Implementation of zero-knowledge authentication inside the client-server application.

The Fiat-Shamir Zero Knowledge Authentication Protocol is a cryptographic protocol that allows a user to authenticate to a server without providing real credentials (such as a password). Instead, the user proves his identity by providing some random information that only he knows and using cryptographic operations to authenticate.
