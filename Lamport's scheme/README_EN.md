# Implementation of authentication inside the client-server application according to the Lamport scheme.

The Lamport Protocol is based on hash functions and assumes that both the client and the server share a secret key (some pre-set value). With each authentication, a one-time password is generated, which is transmitted from the client to the server in encrypted form.
